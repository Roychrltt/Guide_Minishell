# Guide_Minishell

This is a simple guide for minishell with only the wildcard bonus. I added my header file here, in the hope that it would make my explanations more clear.

So there are mainly three parts: parsing, builtins, and pipes(fork and redirection things blahblahblah).

### 1. Parsing
   - expand environmant variables
   - string to tokens
   - get type for tokens
   - deal quotes in tokens

### 2. Builtins
   - echo
   - cd
   - pwd
   - env
   - export
   - exit

### 3. Pipes
   - redirection
   -
