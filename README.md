# Guide_Minishell

This is a simple guide for minishell with only the wildcard bonus. I added my header file here, in the hope that it would make my explanations more clear.

So there are mainly three parts: parsing, builtins, and pipes (fork and redirection things blahblahblah).

### 1. Parsing
   - 1.1 expand environmant variables
   - 1.2 string to tokens
   - 1.3 get type for tokens
   - 1.4 deal quotes in tokens

### 2. Builtins
   - 2.1 echo
   - 2.2 cd
   - 2.3 pwd
   - 2.4 env
   - 2.5 export
   - 2.6 exit

### 3. Pipes
   - redirection
   -
